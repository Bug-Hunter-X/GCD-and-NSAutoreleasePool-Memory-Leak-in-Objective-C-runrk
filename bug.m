In Objective-C, a tricky error can occur when dealing with memory management and `NSAutoreleasePool` in conjunction with Grand Central Dispatch (GCD).  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
- (void)myMethod {
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{
        // Create an object
        MyObject *myObject = [[MyObject alloc] init];

        // Perform some work...
        [myObject doSomething];

        // Object should be released here, but...
        [myObject release]; //Potential memory leak if not handled properly
    });
}
```

The issue arises because the `release` call might occur outside the scope of an `NSAutoreleasePool`.  If the block executes on a different thread, it won't inherit the autorelease pool from the main thread.  This leads to memory leaks as the object isn't properly deallocated.
