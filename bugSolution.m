To fix the memory leak, create a new `NSAutoreleasePool` within the GCD block. This ensures that the object is properly deallocated before the block finishes executing.

```objectivec
- (void)myMethod {
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{
        @autoreleasepool {
            MyObject *myObject = [[MyObject alloc] init];
            [myObject doSomething];
            [myObject release]; // Now properly released
        }
    });
}
```

By using `@autoreleasepool`, we create a new autorelease pool that encompasses the object's lifecycle. Once the block concludes, the autorelease pool is drained, properly releasing the object and preventing the memory leak.  In modern Objective-C, using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) largely avoids this issue; however, understanding this scenario is crucial for projects or contexts where ARC may not be employed.
